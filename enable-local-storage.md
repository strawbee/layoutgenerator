## Google Chrome
Go to Settings (under Chrome -> Preferences, or click the three vertical dots at the top-right of your browser window, then go to Settings in the drop down menu) -> Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select Advanced -> Privacy and Security -> Content Settings -> Cookies -> Make sure "Allow sites to save and read cookie data" is enabled.

## Firefox
type "about:config" in the address bar. There might be a warning about accepting the risks of changing advanced settings; go ahead and accept it. In the new search bar, search for "dom.storage.enabled" and make sure that the value is set to true. If it's not set to true, right click and toggle it to true.

## Safari
Go to Preferences (under Safari > Preferences) -> Privacy -> Cookies and website data -> Make sure "Always allow" is selected.

## Opera
Go to Settings (this may be under Opera -> Preferences) -> Privacy and Security -> Cookies -> Make sure "Allow local data to be set" is selected.

## Microsoft Edge
Got to Settings (You may see a "..." at the top-right corner of your browser. If you click on it, settings should be at the bottom of the drop down menu that pops up) -> View Advanced Settings -> Cookies -> Make sure "Don't Block Cookies" is selected in the drop down list.

## Internet Explorer
Select the Settings/Extras icon (this often looks like a gear in the top-right corner of your browser) -> Internet Options -> Advanced tab -> Go to Security -> make sure "Enable DOM-Storage" is checked.

But seriously, please consider using a different browser if you are using IE. You will have a much better web experience, trust me. [Try Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Firefox and Opera are pretty great, too.
