# Layout Generator by Joy Hou

For my team's final project for Code Fellows course 201, we created a layout generator that can be seen here: https://github.com/strawbee/babyseal (Go Club babySeal!), with the deployed version here: https://strawbee.github.io/babyseal/

I am branching off of that with my individual content contributions and improving it in my spare time as a personal project.
